# Add `pdk config` subcommand

## Summary

Introduce a PDK and project configuration subsystem with a new `pdk config` subcommand providing the user interface
to read and write configuration keys and values.

## Background & Assumptions

Prior to the introduction of the Puppet Development Kit, module development involved the coordination of a set of
distinct tools, rake tasks, etc. which each carried their own implicit and explicit mechanisms for customization and
configuration.

While the PDK has made a lot of strides in providing a unified invocation interface for these tools, thus far we have
not addressed configuration side of the way module developers interact with these tools.

To illustrate this, here is a survey of the current file-based configuration landscape for a single module:

  - metadata.json
  - .sync.yml
  - .fixtures.yml
  - .nodeset.yml
  - .pdkignore
  - .puppet-lint.rc
  - .rspec
  - .rubocop[\_todo].yml
  - .yardopts
  - Rakefile

(Plus the inherent configuration and customization contained within the puppetlabs\_spec\_helper gem and it’s provided
rake tasks, some of which the PDK invokes.)

## Motivation & Goals

- Standardize the way existing module development workflows are configured and customized for PDK users.

- Reduce the number of different ways that module development workflows with PDK are configured and customized.

- Resolve some inconsistencies and design challenges presented by existing PDK features. (See template-url/template-ref
  design discussion and some issues we have had with invalid values cached in answers.json)

- Improve the discoverability of module development configuration and customization. **Currently many of the avenues for
  configuration are based around hidden files and their significance is not obvious to someone who is new to module
  development.**

## Proposed Implementation Design

Implement a new pdk subcommand, `pdk <get|set|remove> config` which will offer the following actions:

Ref: (Verb-Noun Reference)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zX0FJBAvAIK3d3L3QemD2FGQo3EsgMOD0Ha1BYHVYJE]

  - `pdk get config [--format=<format>]`

    Lists the complete, currently resolved configuration, merging all available layers of config and presenting the
    formatted results.

    If run from within a project, will show system, user and project level config.

    If run outside of a project, will only show system and user level config with an indication to the user that the command was not invoked from within a project.


  - `pdk get config <key> [--format=<format>]`

    Retrieves a specific value from the resolved configuration.

    If `<key>` is a leaf node of the configuration graph, this command will return the raw value:

    ```
    $ pdk get config user.default_template.url
    https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates.git
    ```

    If `<key>` is a non-leaf node of the configuration graph, this command will return a structure containing the values
    of all sub-keys of the given key:

    ```
    $ pdk get config user.default_template
    user.default_template.url = https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates.git
    user.default_template.ref = main
    ```

    You can also supply the `--format` option to control how keys and values are presented:

    ```
    $ pdk get config user.default_template.url --format=json
    { "user.default_template.url": "https://github.com/.../pdk-templates.git" }
    ```

    ```
    $ pdk get config user.default_template --format=json
    { "user.default_template.url": "https://github.com/.../pdk-templates.git", "user.default_template.ref": "main" }
    ```

  - `pdk set config [--type|--as <typename>] [--force] <key> [<value>]`

    Sets, updates, or adds to the value(s) in the given configuration key and outputs the new value(s).

    Note that while `<value>` is optional, it can only be omitted in special cases.  For normal usage `<value>` is required.

    If `<key>` is not a leaf node, create an equivalent hash structure.

    If `<key>` already has a value set, issues a notice before replacing existing value.

    If `<key>` is designed to store multiple values (e.g. a list or an array) and `--force` is not used:

      - If the current value list is empty, set the first value in the list to the provided `<value>`.

      - If the current value list is not empty and `<value>` is not already present in the list, add `<value>` to the
        list.

      - If `<value>` is already present in the value list, issues a notice that value was already on list, outputs the
        current values of `<key>`, and exits with a success status.

    If the `--force` flag is set then the `<key>` will be literally set to `<value>`.  That is, list modifications like above will not be used.
    This flag is useful when resetting configuration to a known good state, or when automating the PDK to configure projects on first use.

    If `<key>` is a configuration key where we cannot infer what type of value it should be, the user can include the `--type` (aliased with `--as`) flag
    to indicate what type of value it should be. The included types are those common to JSON and YAML documents (String, Number, Boolean, Array, Hash and Null)

      - `--type number`. Treats the value as a number. For example `1`, `1.0`, `-1.0`

      - `--type boolean`. Treats the value as a boolean (True/False). For example `true`, `TRUE`, `False`, `yes`, `no`, `0` (False), `-1` (True)

      - `--type array`. Treats the value as a array element.  For example `value` would become an array with a single string element of value, that is `["value"]`

      - `--type array`. If given no value, treats the value as an empty array, that is `[]`

      - `--type empty|nil|null|nul`. See [Future Considerations](#future-considerations)

      - `--type string`. The default type for any value.

        Note that `--type hash` does not exist, as this is implied using the `<key>`, for example a key of `setting.a.b.c` will create a Hash like

        ``` json
        "setting": {
          "a": {
            "b": {
              "c": "<value>"
            }
          }
        }
        ```

    Basic usage examples:

    - Known single value key, initial value:

      ```
      $ pdk set config user.default_template.url "https://github.com/scotje/pdk-templates.git"
      pdk (INFO): Set initial value of user.default_template.url to "..."
      https://github.com/scotje/pdk-templates.git
      ```

    - Known single value key, update value:

      ```
      $ pdk set config user.default_template.url "https://github.com/example/repo.git"
      pdk (INFO): Changed existing value of user.default_template.url from "..." to "..."
      https://github.com/example/repo.git
      ```

    - Known multi-value key, initial value:

      ```
      $ pdk set config module.multi.example apple
      pdk (INFO): Added new value "apple" to module.multi.example
      apple
      ```

    - Known multi-value key, additional value:

      ```
      $ pdk set config module.multi.example banana
      pdk (INFO): Added new value "banana" to module.multi.example
      apple
      banana
      ```

    - Known multi-value key, duplicate value:

      ```
      $ pdk set config module.multi.example apple
      pdk (INFO): No changes made to module.multi.example as it already contains value "apple"
      apple
      banana
      ```

    - User-defined key, initial, add, then force a value:

      ```
      $ pdk set config --type array module.x.example strawberry
      pdk (INFO): Set initial value of module.x.example to array with item "strawberry"
      strawberry

      $ pdk set config module.x.example orange
      pdk (INFO): Added new value "orange" to module.x.example
      strawberry
      orange

      $ pdk set config --type boolean --force module.x.example Yes
      pdk (INFO): Set initial value of module.x.example to true
      true
      ```

    - Invalid type conversion:

      ```
      $ pdk set config --type boolean module.x.example strawberry
      pdk (ERROR): Unable to convert 'strawberry' into a boolean

      $ pdk set config --type number module.x.example strawberry
      pdk (ERROR): Unable to convert 'strawberry' into a number
      ```

  - `pdk remove config <key> [<value>|--force]`

    Unset one more more values from the given configuration key.

    If `<key>` is not a leaf node, exits non-zero with an error message.

    If `<key>` currently stores no value, issues a warning but exits with a success status.

    If `<key>` currently stores a single value:

      - If no `<value>` is provided, unsets `<key>`.

      - If provided `<value>`, ignores `<value>` and unsets `<key>`

      - If provided `--force`, issues an info message, and unsets `<key>`

    If `<key>` currently stores multiple values:

      - If no `<value>` is provided, clears all elements in `<key>`

      - If provided `<value>` is present in the list of values for `<key>`, removes value from list. This is matched via string conversion. Unlike `pdk set` there is type conversion available.

      - If provided `<value>` is not present in the list of values for `<key>`, issues a warning but exits with a
        success status.

      - If passed `--force`, unsets `<key>`

    Settings with default values create an interesting UX problem. For example, let's say we have a setting called `user.setting` with a default value of `default-string`. When I run `pdk get config` I end up with:

    ```
    $ pdk get config
    ...
    user.setting=default-string
    ```

    But if I try to remove the setting, and then get its value:

    ```
    $ pdk remove config user.setting
    pdk (INFO): Removed 'user.setting' which had a value of 'default-string'
    user.setting=

    $ be pdk get config
    ...
    user.setting=default-string
    ```

    This makes no sense as I just removed it, why is it back?  The current UX for the configuration system does not tell the user whether a setting is defaulted or explicitly set. So the UX for the `pdk remove config` command must also take into account default values. It should log a message to the user that it attempted to remove the setting, but it is now using a default value. An example is shown below in the "Basic usage examples"

    Basic usage examples:

    - Known single value key, initial value:

      ```
      $ pdk remove config user.setting
      pdk (INFO): Removed 'user.setting' which had a value of 'http://somewhere'
      user.setting=
      ```

    - A key that doesn't exist

      ```
      $ pdk remove config user.missing-setting
      pdk (INFO): Could not remove 'user.missing-setting' as it has not been set
      ```

    - Removing a single value from an array

      ```
      $ pdk remove config user.animal kangaroo
      pdk (INFO): Removed 'kangaroo' from 'user.animal'
      user.animal=["quokka"]
      ```

    - Removing all values from an array

      ```
      $ pdk remove config user.animal
      pdk (INFO): Cleared 'user.animal' which had a value of '["quokka", "kangaroo"]'
      user.animal=[]
      ```

    - Removing an array

      ```
      $ pdk remove config user.animal --force
      pdk (INFO): Removed 'user.animal' which had a value of '["quokka", "kangaroo"]'
      user.animal=
      ```

    - Removing part of a hash

      ```
      $ pdk get config user.setting
      {"foo"=>"bar", "hash"=>{"animals"=>["quokka"]}}

      $ pdk remove config user.setting.hash
      pdk (INFO): Removed 'user.setting.hash' which had a value of '{"animals"=>["quokka"]}'
      user.setting.hash=

      $pdk get config user.setting
      {"foo"=>"bar"}
      ```

    - Removing a setting that has a default value:

      ```
      $ pdk get config
      ...
      user.setting=current-value

      $ pdk remove config user.setting
      pdk (INFO): Could not remove 'user.setting' as it using a default value of 'default-string'
      user.setting=default-string

      $ pdk get config
      ...
      user.setting=default-string
      ```

### Proposed Configuration Keys

#### System Config

The values for these config keys will be persisted in `/opt/puppetlabs/pdk/config` (`%ProgramData%\PuppetLabs\PDK` on Windows).
They are intended to be system-specific settings and will apply to all developer working on the same computer.

These would typically be system level defaults of the same User/Local Config settings defined below. For example:

In the RGBank company, they have their own PDK template store.
To make it easier for onboarding new developers this is stored in the `system.module_defaults.template.url` key.
Developers can choose to override this, by setting `user.module_defaults.template.url`

Setting precedence is discussed in more detail below.

#### User/Local Config

The values for these config keys will be persisted in `~/.config/pdk/user_config.json` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\PDK\user_config.json` on Windows).
They are intended to be developer-specific settings and will not apply to another developer working on the same codebase.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| user.module\_defaults.template.url | Default template URL to use when generating a new module. |
| user.module\_defaults.template.ref | Default template ref to use when generating a new module. (E.g. branch or tag.) |
| user.module\_defaults.metadata.author | Default value for the “author” key in metadata.json for a new module. Supersedes previous ~/.pdk/cache/answers.json functionality. |
| user.module\_defaults.metadata.license | Default value for the “license” key in metadata.json for a new module. Supersedes previous ~/.pdk/cache/answers.json functionality. |
| user.forge.username | Primary Forge username of this developer. Note that this may be an organization rather than a personal username. Used as the default value in metadata.json when generating a new module. Supersedes previous ~/.pdk/cache/answers.json functionality. |
| [user.forge.api\_key] | Placeholder for future Forge API interactions. |
| [user.forge.api\_secret] | Placeholder for future Forge API interactions. |

#### Project-specific Config

The values for these config keys will be persisted in a new .pdk/config file within the project.
Currently a project is only a Puppet Module but in the future this may extend to Control Repos or Bolt projects.
The new file is intended to be checked into VCS and shared with other developers to ensure consistent application of the relevant PDK commands.

For example, in a Module Project:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| project.template.url | Template URL to use for this module. |
| project.template.ref | Template ref to use for this module. Note that this will differ from what is currently stored in metadata.json, this value will be the “desired” reference (e.g. a branch name) but not the specific commit that the module was last updated to. |
| project.template.custom.[...] | Filename based keys with associated config hashes to govern how the template should be applied to this specific module. Supersedes existing .sync.yml settings. |
| project.test.fixtures.[...] | List of additional modules, etc. and associated config hashes needed in order to run unit tests for this module. Supersedes existing .fixtures.yml settings. |
| project.x.[...] | Arbitrary keys and values to be utilized by users to persist data between module developers. Can be used as a basic shared data store for custom developer Rake tasks, etc. |

### More About `project.x`

The `project.x` configuration key space is intended to be used by project developers and third-party tool developers to
persist configuration data that is relevant to all developers of a project. Ultimately we want to avoid any need for
users to add additional configuration files to their projects beyond what `pdk config` uses.

We will define and document best practices around the usage of the `project.x` key space for the community, including
things like:

 - Namespace your custom configuration settings under a key that matches the name of your organization or tool name,
   e.g. `project.x.mycompany`, `project.x.voxpupuli`, or `project.x.super_module_tool`.

 - If your custom configuration is tool-specific, include a key and value that you can use to version your other
   configuration data. That way you can significantly change the configuration format for your tool in the future
   without breaking older versions. E.g. `project.x.super_module_tool.config_version = 1`

 - Plus any other best practices we come up with.

### Setting Precedence

The settings will typically be enforced using the following order:

1. Project
2. User/Local
3. System

Project settings have the highest precedence whereas System settings have the lowest.
That is, if a setting is defined in both Project and System levels, only the Project level will take affect.

Note that **typically** only the User and System settings will overlap.
It is expected that there will be few, if at all, settings that makes sense in the Project and User levels

## Unresolved Questions

- Should we assign expected types to the pre-defined configuration keys so that we can validate new values and report
  errors if the value cannot be coerced to the expected type?

  - _This seems like it will help avoid a lot of pain on the consumer-side of the `pdk config` API and we already have
    the bits in place to validate using JSON-Schema so I recommend we implement types and type validation/coericion for
    all the non-arbitrary keys and values._

## Future Considerations

- We should ensure that the key/value structure we set up is sufficiently extensible for future PDK functionality such
  as control-repo administration, etc.

- `--type empty|nil|null|nul`  In the future, the PDK may distinguish between an empty or nul value versus a missing value. This could be done using the `--type` keyword.

## Drawbacks

- There is a lot of existing documentation and accumulated tribal knowledge in the community around how to configure
  module development through things like `.sync.yml`.

  - Some of the issues here can be mitigated by integrating automatic migration of relevant configuration from files
    like `.sync.yml`, `.fixtures.yml`, etc. into `pdk config` equivalents.

- Existing tooling like `pdksync`, etc. will have to be updated to use the `pdk config` subsystem. This includes any
  tools that PDK uses internally.


## Alternatives

- Maintain status quo, with improved documentation and education about what can be configured, which files to update,
  etc.

- Create a similar `pdk config` subcommand but have a translation layer that actually persists configuration in the
  existing files, rather than in new files.
